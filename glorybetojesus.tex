\beginlyrics
Who in bitter pains\\
Pour'd for me the life-blood\\
From His sacred veins.

\verse2. Grace and life eternal\\
In that blood I find:\\
Blest be His compassion,\\
Infinitely kind.

\verse3. Blest through endless ages\\
Be the precious stream,\\
Which from endless torment\\
Doth the world redeem.

\verse4. There the fainting spirit\\
Drinks of life her fill;\\
There as in a fountain\\
Laves herself at will.

\beginlyrics

\verse5. Abel's blood for vengeance\\
Pleaded to the skies;\\
But the blood of Jesus\\
For our pardon cries.

\verse6. Oft as it is sprinkled\\
On our guilty hearts,\\
Satan in confusion\\
Terror--struck departs.

\verse7. Oft as earth exalting\\
Wafts its praise on high,\\
Hell with horror trembles;\\
Heav'n is filled with joy.

\verse8. Lift ye, then, your voices;\\
Swell the mighty flood;\\
Louder still and louder,\\
Praise the Precious Blood.

\endlyrics
