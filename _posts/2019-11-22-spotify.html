<p>
This playlist goes back to September 2014 when I tried using [Tumblr](https://newbookoldhymns.tumblr.com) to collect recordings to support my hymnbook. You see, this music is so awesome that many, many, many professional artists have made recordings already!
</p><p>
Tumblr had/has a facility to embed music from Spotify, so I started learning about Spotify and started compiling a playlist and here it is:

<p>I don't think it covers the entire book. It's hard to assess this, but it does give another option for providing recordings on this webpage. Maybe have a playlist for each piece. Maybe a little Spotify icon to accompany the half dozen icons already meant to hold resources.</p>
<p>I can see this may take me another 5 years to finish, but you have to start somewhere.</p>
