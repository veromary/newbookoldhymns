title: New Old Edition

Someone asked to bring back some features of the third edition.  It proved a little trickier this time as the new version of LuaTeX has let go some backwards compatibility features, and two dear fonts (Priory by Paul Lloyd and Humanist Minuscule by Peter Wilson) don't seem to be working 100%.

Anyway, I've made a new fork in the github repo and two new lulu projects:

[Coil Bound](http://www.lulu.com/shop/veronica-brandt/a-new-book-of-old-hymns-coil-bound-3rd-ed/paperback/product-22946724.html) at AU$14 and [paperback](http://www.lulu.com/shop/veronica-brandt/a-new-book-of-old-hymns-3rd-ed-digest/paperback/product-22946755.html) at AU$12 with a 10% discount as it's slightly smaller (and cheaper) paperback than I was using before.  I actually find it a bit handier and the printing is still the same size, just a little less margin space.

Enjoy!
