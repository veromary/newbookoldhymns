Gaudete!

As this one is in four parts, I enlisted the help of some of my children, which was a lot of fun, plus interesting to see myself kinda conducting.

Here is the podcast:

[Here is the hymn's page here](https://newbookoldhymns.brandt.id.au/hymns/gaudete.html)

Gaudete, gaudete, Christus est natus  
Ex Maria Virgine, gaudete  

Tempus adest gratiae  
Hoc quod optabamus  
Carmina laetitiae  
Devote redamus  

Deus homo factus est  
Natura mirante  
Mundus renovatus est  
A Christo regnante

Ezechielis porta  
Clausa pertransitur  
Unde lux est orta  
Salus invenitur

Ergo nostra contio  
Psallat iam in lustro  
Benedicat Domino  
Salus Regi nostro

or in English:

Rejoice, Rejoice! Christ is born of the Virgin Mary! Rejoice!

The time of grace has come for which we have prayed. Let us devoutly sing songs of joy!

God is made man, while nature wonders. The world is renewed by Christ the King.

The closed gate of Ezekiel has been passed through. Whence the light has risen, salvation is found.

Therefore let our assembly sing praises at this time of purification. Let us bless the Lord! Greetings to our King!
