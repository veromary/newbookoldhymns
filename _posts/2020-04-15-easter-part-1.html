It's been a while since we last made a podcast for A New Book of Old Hymns. Last year we made one for <a href="https://anchor.fm/veronica-brandt/episodes/New-Book-Old-Hymns-1---Pope-and-Advent-e93s26">Advent</a> then another for <a href="https://anchor.fm/veronica-brandt/episodes/New-Book-Old-Hymns-2---Christmas-e9imvr">Christmas</a> but then stalled while our country was inundated with bushfires, then floods and now this crazy virus.

We'll have to record some pick up episodes to cover the Feast of the Holy Name of Jesus and Candlemas and Lent and Passiontide. For now let's go with Easter.
