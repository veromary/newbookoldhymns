Here's an idea:

![Chant Colouring Page]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/coloring/subtuumedge.png)

Ideas:

 * Colour in the "do"clef (the C on the second line from the top on each line of music) and then find all the notes on that line and colour them in the same colour.
 * Make a colour code for each pitch - eg, "do"=red, "re"=purple, "mi"=blue ...
 * Decorate the drop cap "S"
 * Colour as you learn the tune

The Monks at Notre Dame Priory in Tasmania sing this one after every Mass. You can watch the [livestream](https://www.notredamemonastery.org/livemass) each morning.
