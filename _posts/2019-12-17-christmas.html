I've just cobbled together the second instalment in the project to record all the music in A New Book of Old Hymns - the podcast Radio Public widget should appear here:

In other news, today is the 17th December which is the first day of the O Antiphons! There are many forms this can take. The original are the Magnificat Antiphons for Vespers, so you would sing the O Antiphon of the day, then the Magnificat in Mode 2, then back to the O Antiphon.
</p>
<p>
It was also adapted into that ever popular Carol: O Come O Come Emmanuel, or in the Latin Veni Veni Emmanuel or Veni O Sapientia as I have it <a href="{{ site.url }}/hymns/veni.html">in the Hymnbook</a>.
</p>
<p>
The "O Come O Come Emmanuel" verse that is so famous is from the O Antiphon on 23rd December. J M Neale put that one first then worked backwards through to 17th December. In A New Book of Old Hymns I started with "Veni O Sapientia" / "O Come Thou Wisdom" which is the 17th December and proceeded through to Emmanuel last.
</p>

<p>Also worth repeating is the acrostic in the petitions - which is visible when putting the 23rd December first:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>E</strong>mmanuel</li>
	<li><strong>R</strong>ex Gentium - King of Nations</li>
	<li><strong>O</strong>riens - Daystar</li>
	<li><strong>C</strong>lavis Davidica - Key of David</li>
	<li><strong>R</strong>adix Jesse - Root of Jesse</li>
	<li><strong>A</strong>donai - Lord</li>
	<li><strong>S</strong>apientia - Wisdom</li>
</ul>
<p>Ero Cras means I will come tomorrow. Cras is where we get the word <em>procrastinate</em> meaning <em>for tomorrow</em>.</p>
<p>
Happy Christmas everyone! Next section of the book is for the feast of the Holy Name of Jesus - 2nd January - so I'd better get working on that one!
