Here's the hymn page here: [Ave Verum](/hymns/aveverum.html)

Here's the podcast embed thing:

And here's the youtube embed:

You would be amazed how much feedback means to me - there should be Disqus comments here. Comments on Youtube are great. Anchor, the podcast thing, has a way to send audio feedback ready to use in future episodes.

God bless,

Veronica
