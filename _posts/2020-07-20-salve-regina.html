<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/hymns/salveregina.html"><strong>Salve Regina</strong></a> is a well known hymn. I thought it would be a good one to start with, as it is well known, plus I taught it to a group of homeschoolers back in 2014.
</p>
<p>
So, here's a list of things you should be able to find on the <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/hymns/salveregina.html">Salve Regina page</a>.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
 An excerpt from the hymnbook</li><li>
 A quizlet set which you can use to learn the vocabulary</li><li>
 A link to a youtube video with a professional choir - should I make that an embed so that you don't have to click into the youtube website? An embed should avoid some advertising.
</li><li> A new quick mp3 podcast - I could turn this into a video and use that to replace the other youtube link - would a video version help?
</li><li> A crossword puzzle - plus the Old Salve Files have three graded crossword puzzles.
</li><li> A memrise course - Memrise is a handy thing and the free level is fine for learning stuff. For third party memrise courses like mine, you need to log in and add them to your account in a web browser, then they're available through the app. You can't search for it through the app itself.
</li><li> Scrolling to the bottom of the page there's a quiz, adapted from the Old Salve Files, which should show a video of me saying congratulations if you get a good score.
</li><li> Just under the quiz is a link to a pdf Certificate which I put together for the 2014 class, and which I cannot remember how I produced, so if that's a really useful thing, then I will need to put on my thinking cap again.
</li></ul>
<p>
So, that's lots of stuff!
</p>
<p>
Please let me know which bits are useful. I don't think I can do all those different things for every hymn, so I'd like to focus on what parents and students find helpful.
