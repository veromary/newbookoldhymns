I've updated the page for [Veni Sancte Spiritus](/hymns/venisancte.html)

Getting kids singing chant, showing that it would be great to have Gregorian chant as a part of everyday life, showing that it is possible to have Gregorian chant as a part of everyday life, that is still important to me.

So, I give that a go in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kolNLjxuwk8).

And I realize that I need to teach my kids more. While I can see with my older kids that they do get there eventually.

The other bonus of making these videos is that uploading them maxxes out our household internet, so we get a bit of a holiday from the internet for a few hours.
