<div data-gloss>
<p>Haec dies, quam fecit Dominus.</p>
<p>Haec dies, quam fecit Dominus.</p>
<p>This day, which {hath made} Lord.</p>
<p>This is the day which the Lord hath made.</p>
</div>

<div data-gloss>
<p>exultemus et laetemur in ea,</p>
<p>exultemus et laetemur in ea,</p>
<p>{let us exult} and {let us rejoice} in this</p>
<p>In which let us rejoice and be glad.</p>
</div>

Exultemus and laetemur could both be "let us rejoice". Laetemur is in the passive voice, so might be better as "let us be glad". Either way you get the happy vibe.

This is probably the first melismatic piece I learned, as we were singing Compline at home and this is sung daily during the Easter Octave. I wanted the book to show a bit of everything to do with Gregorian chant, so added it in.
