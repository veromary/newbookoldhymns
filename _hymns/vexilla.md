The Vespers hymn for Passiontide - the time from the Sunday before Palm Sunday up to Holy Week.  Some would cover all statues and crucifixes with purple cloth for this time, to be unveiled during the Sacred Triduum - crucifixes on Friday and the rest at the Gloria on Saturday night.

This is yet another hymn that suffered revisions under Pope Urban VIII. In A New Book of Old Hymns I followed the Urbanite text as in the Liber Usualis. Below I go back to the older text, though they are very similar.

### Following the words by Venantius Fortunatus

Vexilla Regis prodeunt;
fulget Crucis mysterium,
quo carne carnis conditor
suspensus est patibulo.</p>

<p>Banners {of the King} {they go out}
shines {of the Cross} mystery
who flesh {of flesh} maker
suspended is {from the fork-shaped yoke or gibbet for criminals}</p>
<p>Abroad the royal banners fly
And bear the gleaming Cross on high
That Cross whereon Life suffered death
And gave us life with dying breath.</p>
