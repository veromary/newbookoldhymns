The Sequence for Pentecost - each pair of verses has a new tune. Also known as the Golden Sequence because it's so beautiful - a masterpiece of Latin poetry.

<p>Veni sancte Spiritus, et emitte caelitus lucis tuae radium.</p>
<p>Veni sancte Spiritus, et emitte caelitus tuae radium lucis.</p>
<p>Come Holy Spirit and send thy ray {of light} </p>
<p>COME, Holy Ghost,
send down those beams,
which sweetly flow in silent streams
from Thy bright throne above.</p>
</div>
