Christus Vincit is a rousing call and respomse type chant from the 8th century or thereabouts.

There are lots of different versions - even A New Book of Old Hymns has included two different versions over time:

 * [2014 pdf excerpt]({{ siteurl }}{{ site.baseurl }}/pdf/christusvincit2014.pdf) - a Sarum one from the [Christus Rex Ballarat to Bendigo Pilgrimage](http://www.crex.org)
 * [2016 pdf excerpt]({{ siteurl }}{{ site.baseurl }}/pdf/christusvincit.pdf) - a more generic one from the [Pius X Hymnbook by Percy Jones](http://www.ccwatershed.org/blog/2014/mar/15/hymnal-st-pius-x/) - actually, this was the first version I typed up, so much earlier copies of the hymnbook use this one too.

Here is another variation - much like my 2016 version. Great video from [ccwatershed](http://www.ccwatershed.org)
