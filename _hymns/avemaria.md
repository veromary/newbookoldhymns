Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum.

Ave Maria, plena gratia, Dominus tecum.
</p>
<p>Hail Mary full {of grace} {the Lord} {is with thee}</p>
<p>Hail Mary full of grace, the Lord is with thee.</p>
</div>

A little note while I think of it. The word for *of grace* would be *gratiae* rather than *gratia* but I think the literal sense here would be something like **grace-full**. The KJV wanted to downplay this so used the translation *highly favoured*. The traditional understanding is that *grace-full* is akin to *immaculate* or *sinless* - as Mary is full of grace, there is no room for any sins.

There are *so many* settings of the Ave Maria, but most people assume the Schubert or sometimes the Bach-Gounod soprano pieces designed for solo showcasing. These settings don't work so well for choirs.

The hymnbook has the Gregorian antiphon and an easy round setting.
