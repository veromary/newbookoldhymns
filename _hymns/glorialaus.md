Initially I picked [A video from a Papal Palm Sunday at the Vatican](https://youtu.be/3jsKmfwkq_E) - I like to show the hymns in action, so to speak. The only snag is that verses there are polyphonic, so a bit trickier to hear the melody.

My family tends to sing this a whole lot faster - it's one that lends itself to a drum beat, though the end of the antiphon breaks the rhythm a little.  I should get a video...
