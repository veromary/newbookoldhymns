Probably better known as **Veni, Veni Emmanuel** - a hymn version of the O Antiphons - the antiphons for the Magnificat for Vespers (evening prayer) for the last seven days of Advent.

The Sapientia verse is sung first, so I've set it first, but if you do put the verses backwards you get this anagram:

* **E**mmanuel
* **R**ex Gentium
* **O**riens
* **C**lavis Davidica
* **R**adix Jesse
* **S**apientia

Which spells out ERO CRAS which means *I'm coming tomorrow*.
