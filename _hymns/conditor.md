# Conditor Alme Siderum

Was revised as Creator Alme Siderum by Pope Urban's reforms, but more recent books have gone back to "Conditor" and the Monastic books stayed with Conditor the whole time.

A hymn for Advent Vespers.

So, when I first put the hymnbooks together I typed up Creator Alme Siderum out of the Liber Usualis.  I picked the translation beginning "Bright builder of the heav'nly poles" - I can't remember why, as my favourite is Caswall's with the line "when friends shall fail and foes combine".  These translations match the Urban VIII text, which is what I had, so all was good.

Then, as music at the Maternal Heart was going all Monastic/Benedictine, I changed the text to the pre Urban VIII version, but I didn't change the translation - so the Latin and English didn't really match that well.

Sometimes the Urban VIII changes don't make much difference, but in this case they really do, so now I need to change the English translation and I'll go with J M Neale's text.  Which makes a second revision to the Fourth Edition of A New Book of Old Hymns. (The first revision changed the chant Christus Vincit).
