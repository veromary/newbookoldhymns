I have been a bit lazy this week - hopefully I can come back and fix the gloss up.  I hope it makes sense enough as it is. The subject and object of a sentence in English depends on word order, whereas in Latin this is indicated by word endings (or inflections as I believe they are known).

This is a short piece. Sometimes we repeat the first 3 verses at Mass, saving the last verse for last.

Many hymns end with a Doxology or some variation on the prayer we know as the **Glory Be**. Sometimes when we're running short of time and can't sing the whole hymn we skip to the last verse to finish with the Trinity.
