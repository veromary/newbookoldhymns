Simple Roman Salve Regina - the Marian Antiphon for "Ordinary Time" or Time after Pentecost.

I taught this vocabulary a few years ago with [This Collection of Resources](http://www.kidschant.com/salve/index.html)

I also put together a [Memrise Course](http://www.memrise.com/course/377696/salve-regina/)
