This is the Introit or Entrance Antiphon for a Mass of the Dead.  

"What's an Introit doing in a book of hymns?" I hear you ask.  Well, this book is really more of an eclectic collection of all my favourite music from the turn of the millennium from the [Maternal Heart of Mary Church](http://maternalheart.org).  The Requiem Introit was one of those pieces that became a singalong piece for me.
