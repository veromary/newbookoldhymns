Attende Domine is a simple Lenten antiphon.

The boy band, Libera, did an interesting cover of this piece.  If you go in for that sort of music, [here it is](https://youtu.be/JPpkHPbjhgc).

For the crossword and the quizlet set I have only gone so far as the first verse.  I'm doing this at the beginning of the year, so thought it prudent to take it easy.
