I don't usually pick orchestral arrangements of pieces in this hymnbook but when the conductor turns around it's awesome - it's a singalong!

<div data-gloss>
<p>Dona nobis pacem</p>
<p>Dona nobis pacem</p>
<p>Grant {to us} peace</p>
<p>Grant us peace</p>
</div>

I'm not going to be able to make a crossword puzzle from three words.
