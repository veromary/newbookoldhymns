Pope Urban the Somethingth strikes again!

My hymnbook was transcribed largely from the Liber Usualis circa 1962 which uses the "improvements" from the humanist Pope Urban.

One praiseworthy development of the Second Vatican Council and ensuing liturgical upheavals was to roll back these misguided revisions and go back to the Medieval Latin, or close enough.

So, in fine, I can't seem to find a video to perfectly match my hymnbooks, and I'm not sure it's worth pursuing.  The differences are minor enough that you can learn the tune - the transposition of the words _silva_ and _talem_ in the chorus are the main difficulty. If you can cope with that, then you'll do well.

At least now I know why I keep getting those words mixed up when I go to sing it!

Nevertheless this remains one of my favourites.
