This is the most ancient surviving hymn to Our Lady. [Preces Thesaurus](http://www.preces-latinae.org/thesaurus/BVM/SubTuum.html) says it's indulgenced - double your merit!

I met this hymn at [Maternal Heart](http://maternalheart.org.au) where they sing it after *every Mass*. Because some of the people who started the rebirth of the Maternal Heart church as a Latin Mass community were into the whole Benedictine thing, so they used the Monastic version of the antiphon - the Antiphonale Monasticum not the Liber Usualis. The two versions have a lot in common, but I'm going with the Monastic here as the influence of that Sydney based Latin Mass has been enormous and thinking of how the congregation there joins in with gusto at the end of each Mass - the proportion of people in Sydney who can sing this piece probably learned the Monastic version from Maternal Heart.

And the Monastic is the older version.
