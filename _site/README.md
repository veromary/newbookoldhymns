A New Book of Old Hymns

This book came about after frustration in trying to find out what the beautiful music at Mass meant.  

It was originally written using OpusTeX, which is no longer under development.  Now I am rewriting it with [gregorio](http://gregoriochant.org).

Printed copies are available through Lulu.  Checkout [the brandt bookshop](http://lulu.com/brandt)

Changelog
=========

Feels a bit late to start a changelog, but here goes.

2020 11 21

I've just updated Rorate Caeli's translations, taken the erroneous accent out of CONditor alme siderum and I think there was something else.

But I haven't changed the Lulu and Amazon copies yet.

Earlier I did update Lulu and Amazon when the error in Ave Maris Stella (non/nos culpis solutos) became apparent. But I forgot to update Selz.

Before that, I think the last update was rogaturus in Dies Irae, for which there was a note in the Selz thing - so that would have been the last update for Selz.
