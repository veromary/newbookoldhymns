A New Book of Old Hymns

This book came about after frustration in trying to find out what the beautiful music at Mass meant.  

It was originally written using OpusTeX, which is no longer under development.  Now I am rewriting it with [gregorio](http://gregoriochant.org).

Printed copies are available through Lulu.  Checkout [the brandt bookshop](http://lulu.com/brandt)
