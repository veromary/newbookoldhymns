With fervent\beginlyrics love for men,\\

Shall raise its joyful strain.

Blest be with loudest song\\

By every heart and tongue.

\beginlyrics

\verse2. O Heart, for me on fire\\
With love no man can speak,\\
My yet untold desire\\
God gives me for Thy sake.

\verse3. When life away is flying,\\
And earth's false glare is done;\\
Still, Sacred Heart, in dying\\
I'll say I'm all Thy own.

\endlyrics
