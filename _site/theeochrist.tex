\textinitial{T}{hee, O Christ,} the Prince of Ages,\\}
Thee\beginlyrics the nations glorious King,\\
Praise we now with exultation \\
Men and angels answering,\\
And to Thee with meek devotion\\
Hearts and minds and senses bring.

\verse2. Come, O Lord, assume Thy Kingship\\
Rebel hearts Thy pow'r can gain;\\
Bend the stubborn will of rulers,\\
Who from homage still refrain;\\
In the home as in the city\\
Be supreme, O Christ, and reign.

\verse3. From our own dear land, O Saviour,\\
Drive the night of heresy\\
That, in holy Church united,\\
All may love and worship Thee: \\
Who, upon the Cross uplifted\\
Draws mankind in Charity.

\endlyrics
