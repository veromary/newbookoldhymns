Priest\beginlyrics and Lamb, the throne is Thine,\\
King whose reign shall never cease,\\
Prince of everlasting peace.

\verse Ant. Angels, saints and nations sing,\\
Praised be Jesus Christ, our King,\\
Lord of life, earth sky and sea,\\
King of love on Calvary.

\verse2. King, whose name creation thrills,\\
Rule our minds, our hearts, our wills,\\
Till in peace each nation rings\\
With Thy praises King of Kings.

\verse3. King most holy, King of truth,\\
Guide the lowly, guard the youth;\\
Christ Thou King of glory bright,\\
Be to us eternal light.

\verse4. Shepherd-King, o'er mountain steep,\\
Homeward bring the wandering sheep;\\
Shelter in one royal fold\\
States and kingdoms new and old.
