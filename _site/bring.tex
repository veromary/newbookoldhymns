And made His Father's anger cease,\\

\verse3. Life died, but soon revived again,\\
And even death by it was slain,\\
Alleluia, alleluia.\\

I saw Himself and Him adored;\\
Alleluia, alleluia.\\
I saw the napkin and the sheet,\\
That bound His hands and wrapped His feet:''

On this Thy rising day rejoice;\\

By grace and love us sinners save:
