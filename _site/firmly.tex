\textinitial{F}{irmly} I believe and truly\\}
God is Three\beginlyrics and God is One;\\
And I next acknowledge duly\\
Manhood taken by the Son.

\verse2. And I trust and hope most fully\\
In that manhood crucified;\\
And each thought and deed unruly\\
Do to death as He has died.

\verse3. Simply to His grace and wholly\\
Light and life and strength belong,\\
And I love supremely, solely,\\
Him the holy, Him the strong.

\verse4. And I hold in veneration,\\
For the love of Him alone,\\
Holy Church as His creation,\\
and her teachings as His own.

\verse5. Adoration ay be given,\\
With and through th'angelic host,\\
To the God of earth and heaven,\\
Father, Son and Holy Ghost.
