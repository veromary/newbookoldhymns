{\leftskip1em
\textinitial{F}{or all the saints} who from their labours rest,\\}
Who\beginlyrics Thee by faith before the world confest,\\
Thy Name, O Jesu, be for ever blest. Alleluia!

\verse2. Thou wast their Rock, their Fortress and their Might;\\
Thou, Lord, their Captain in the well-fought fight;\\
Thou in the darkness drear their one true Light. Alleluia!

\verse3. O may Thy soldiers, faithful, true and bold,\\
Fight as the Saints who nobly fought of old,\\
And win, with them, the victor's crown of gold. Alleluia!

\verse4. And when the strife is fierce, the warfare long,\\
Steals on the ear the distant triumph song,\\
And hearts are brave again, and arms are strong.  Alleluia!

\verse5. But lo!  there breaks a yet more glorious day;\\
The Saints triumphant rise in bright array:\\
The King of glory passes on His way.  Alleluia!

\verse6. From earth's wide bounds, from ocean's farthest coast,\\
Through gates of pearl streams in the countless host,\\
Singing to Father, Son and Holy Ghost.  Alleluia!
