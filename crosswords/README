generating crosswords:

cwg
===

- outputs LaTeX, but doesn't order the box numbers
- a bit fiddly fixing box numbers, but not impossible
- 22 boxes is a good width for a standard A4 paper layout
- would be good to magnify the output
- editing the tex file, removing [small] option from usepackage{crossword} and adding usepackage[cm]{fullpage} helps
- enlarge clues with \renewcommand\PuzzleClueFont{\rm\normalsize}

- sort with:
        sort temp > sorted

genxword 
========

- doesn't output LaTeX, but does svg
- pdf output tends to push Down clues on to page 2

inkscape converts svg to pdf:

 inkscape -z -D --file=input.svg --export-pdf=output.pdf
