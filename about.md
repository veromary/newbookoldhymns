A collection of hymns focusing on chant, including a litany, rounds, antiphons, carols, for all seasons of the Church's year, plus Ordinaries of the Mass, Benediction and some English hymns. Chant is newly typeset, not photocopied. English translations accompany each Latin hymn. Indexed for easy reference.

This Fourth Edition updates the Prayer for the Pope with a new illustration of Pope Francis as well as lots of little improvements including the addition of a popular setting of Christus Vincit.
