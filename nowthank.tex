\textinitial{N}{ow} thank we all our God,\\}
With heart and \beginlyrics mind and voices,\\
Who wondrous things hath done,\\
In whom the world rejoices;\\
Who from our mother's arms\\
Hath blessed us on our way\\
With countless gifts of love,\\
And still is ours today.

\verse2. Oh may this bounteous God\\
Through all our life be near us,\\
With ever joyful hearts\\
And blessed peace to cheer us;\\
And keep us in His grace,\\
And guide us when perplexed,\\
And free us from all ills\\
I this world and the next.

\verse3. All praise and thanks to God\\
The Father now be given,\\
The Son, and Him who reigns\\
With Them in highest heaven,\\
Eternal Three in One\\
Whom earth and heav'n adore;\\
For thus it was, is now,\\
And shall be ever more.
